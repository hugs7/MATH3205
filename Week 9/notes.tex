Markowitz or Mean/Variance Models

Sets
$N$ assets we want to invest in

Data
$r_i$ return on asset $i \in N$
Typically these are slightly greater than 1.

$W$ Covariance Matrix

We assume the returns have a multivariate normal distribution

Variables

$x_i$ is the fraction of our portfolio investged in each asset

Maximise return

\[\max (\lambda sum_{i\in N} r_i x_i - (1-\lambda) x^T w X)\]

with
$\lambda \in (0,1)$

subject to

\[\sum_{i\in N} x_i = 1\]

General second order cone constraint

\[\boldsymbol{x}^\top W \boldsymbol{x} \le z\]

Where $x\ge 0$ and $z \ge 0$ are variables and $W$ is a positive semi-definite matrix.



Gurobi can do second order cone constraints because the Barrier algorithm turns regular constraints into these.
Solvable in polynomial time

Value at Risk and Conditional Value at Risk
(VaR) (CVaR)

Sample average approximation (SAA)

Assume we want VaR and CVaR at the $\alpha$ level (e.g. the bottom $5\%$).

Sets
$S$ samples

Data
$r_{is}$ return for investment $i \in N$ in sample $s \in S$

Variables
$\beta_s$ return of sample $s \in S$.
$\text{Var}$ estimate of VaR from samples
$\text{CVar}$ esstimate of CVaR from samples
$\beta^{-}$ the amount by which the return of scenario $s \in S$ is below $\text{Var}$

Objective

\[ \max \frac{\lambda}{|S|} \sum_{s \in S} + (1 - \lambda)\text{CVar} \]

Subject to

\[ \sum_{i\in N} x_i = 1 \]

\[ \beta_s = \sum_{ i \in N } r_{is} X_i, \hspace{1cm} \forall s \in S \]

\[ \beta_s + \beta_s^{-} \ge \text{Var}, \hspace{1cm} \forall s \ in S \]

\[ \text{CVar} = \text{Var} - \frac{1}{\alpha |S|} \sum_{s \in S} \beta^{-} \]
