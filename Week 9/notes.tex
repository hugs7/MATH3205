Markowitz or Mean/Variance Models

Sets
$N$ assets we want to invest in

Data
$r_i$ return on asset $i \in N$
Typically these are slightly greater than 1.

$W$ Covariance Matrix

We assume the returns have a multivariate normal distribution

Variables

$x_i$ is the fraction of our portfolio investged in each asset

Maximise return

\[\max (\lambda sum_{i\in N} r_i x_i - (1-\lambda) x^T w X)\]

with
$\lambda \in (0,1)$

subject to

\[\sum_{i\in N} x_i = 1\]

General second order cone constraint

\[\boldsymbol{x}^\top W \boldsymbol{x} \le z\]

Where $x\ge 0$ and $z \ge 0$ are variables and $W$ is a positive semi-definite matrix.



Gurobi can do second order cone constraints because the Barrier algorithm turns regular constraints into these.
Solvable in polynomial time
